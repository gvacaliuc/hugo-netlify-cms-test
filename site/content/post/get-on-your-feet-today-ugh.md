We live in a world where technology keeps us accountable for everything. Push notifications on phone workout apps saying “looks like you haven’t worked out in a while, Klara!”, your smart watch telling you to stand up, your credit card app telling you that you’ve overstepped your weekly spending budget, and of course the access to people who aren’t around you always texting you and asking, “what’s up?” (Do I really tell them what is actually up?) These seem like a great idea, when we are setting up our new diet, our new workout plans for weight loss, and when we are planning a new budget. And they not only seem like a great idea, they ARE a great idea. Reminders when you’re motivated to do something don’t feel like reminders. They feel like tiny victories, because of the attitude that, “I was already planning on it.” When we get motivated, we WANT to have accountability. Because we really WANT to accomplish our goals. But then week two hits… maybe if you’re like me, it’s only day five. We hit snooze on our 7 am alarm to get up and work out. We get out of bed and pretend to forget that “oh! I was supposed to workout this morning, oops.” Then, after that, It’s one thing after another. Not working out, not tracking meals, and day by day, “forgetting” to do the simple things that you were once so motivated to do. And that’s when technology steps in as an enemy. Your apps, your phone, your watch, they all start telling you everything you’re doing wrong. And let me tell you, it’s extremely discouraging. 

I recently found myself in this situation. And on paper, it seems so easy to fix. If you are unmotivated, just turn off the notifications, delete the app, and move on. But if I let unmotivation win, then I lose. I don’t want to turn off the notifications because I want to accomplish my goals. So, I continue to receive little pushes to go outside, stand up, pay my credit card bill, eat healthy, check my blood sugar, and text back all my friends. And that’s when the depression hits. With the realization that I’ve officially given up…

	What prompts me to write this is my bathroom scale. I’ve been avoiding it for weeks now because it sends my weight directly to my iphone, and in turn, sends it to all my health apps to let them know I’ve completely let go. I’m not fat, I don’t like to use the word fat. But I hate the way my body looks. And that’s what prompts all the issues surrounding my image. 

	I’m posting this to hold myself accountable for once. I need to stop letting technology control how i feel. I am the author of my own days, and I want my days to look healthy and happy. 

	Today when I stepped on my scale, I weighed 151.4 lbs. I immediately got a notification that said, “You’re up 14.6 lbs from last month.” It was a huge disappointment as well as a huge wake up call. 

	You can’t change yesterday but you can plan for tomorrow. Hello, World. My name is Klara Linn and I’m excited to share my journey with you.
