2020 started off just like any other new year. You see quotes and posts about how “2020 is going to be OUR year!” and your feed is flooded with positivity and motivation. You seemingly create goals for the year that lie ahead of you and you go to sleep increasingly more optimistic than you were just a few weeks ago.

And of course what happens next is clockwork. Some people keep their motivation, some people don’t, everything is going back to the way it was before but then, BAM. In a strange turn of events, 2020 has become the literal end of the world. Obviously, with any circumstance, some people experience it worse or better than others, I’m not trying to dwell too much on circumstance, but it is unanimous that 2020 is not our year after all.

For me, 2020 started off already dragging a huge list of resolutions behind me. But seeing how unhappy I was with my life as a whole, I had no doubt that I would achieve all my goals. I was extremely optimistic and motivated to make 2020 my year. I had a myriad of goals including losing weight, better diabetes management, financial goals, educational goals, and several other things that would contribute very positively to my life. For the most part, I was on track. I read a book a week, I cut my alcohol consumption in half, I went to the gym every day between classes, I worked as much as I could, I tried eating out less, and I picked up my hobby of painting again. It really felt like 2020 was going to be alright for me. Banned from

Then I lost my job, ran out of money, finally got a new job, then I was banned from my spring break trip because covid-19 was at its start in the US. Once the virus got worse, my spring semester was switched to entirely online, I was laid-off, forced to file for unemployment, and I packed my bags to go move back in with my parents while still paying my rent because I couldn’t make it on my own. I was put in the hospital for Diabetic Ketoacidosis, my dog was put down, and my family was left struggling after both my mother and my brother also lost their jobs. I wonder if things could get any worse, but I suppose they have to before things start getting better.

I know that all of this is crazy. I know that 2020 might not be the year all of us inspired hippies were hoping for. But as musician Morgan Harper Nicholas once said, “You have grown so much since last year.” This rings true for all of us. Instead of letting 2020 be the worst year yet, let 2020 be the year you go after courage and strength. Do something worthwhile. Get out the sidewalk chalk that hasn’t been used in years, buy a fish, drink a lot of water and go on runs. Just remember on the days you feel down, happiness comes in waves and it will find you again, much sooner than you think.
