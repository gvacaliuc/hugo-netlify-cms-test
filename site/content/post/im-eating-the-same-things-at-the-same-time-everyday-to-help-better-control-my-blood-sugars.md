There are so many factors that affect blood sugar other than carbohydrates. Stress, sleep, exercise, fiber, caffeine, alcohol, sugars, artificial sugars, and so much more. My blood sugar charts look like a really scary roller coaster so I figured I would try to challenge myself. 

I said before that there is no clear rhyme or reason to what controls my blood sugar, but by taking the success I've had from multiple times over multiple days, I can create a plan for myself and my blood sugars that will hopefully result in my blood sugar chart flattening out and avoiding several spikes and drops throughout the day. 

So here's the plan: 

Go to bed and wake up with a good fasting blood sugar. I can't start my challenge on the wrong foot. 

1. Wake up at 8:30 am. Immediately give 2 units of insulin before getting out of bed. Why? My blood sugar always spikes as soon as I get out of bed and so i'm giving a unit to account for that, and then another unit to account for my iced latte with almond milk that I drink first thing in the morning. 



2. After finishing the latte, i do my morning stretches and then proceed to make myself some breakfast. After stretching, at approximately 9:45 am, I am going to give myself 4.8 units of insulin, to cover the carbohydrates in my breakfast which includes: 

* bagel thin (25g carbs, 100 calories)
* 1tbs of lowfat garden veggie cream cheese (1g carbs, 30 calories)
* 50 grams of sliced avocado (4g carbs, 80 calories)
* 57 grams of blueberries (8g carbs, 32 calories)
* 50 grams of egg whites (1g carbs, 30 calories)

Breakfast Total: 39g Carbohydrates, 281 Calories, 4.8 units of insulin. To be eaten at 10 am.

PSA: yes i will be weighing the exact amount of  food i need on my food scale....



3. For a snack during classes, before lunch, I will be eating hummus and crackers. I will give 2.7 units of insulin, to cover the carbohydrates in my snack, which includes: 

* crunchmaster, ultimate everything crackers (20g carbs, 140 calories)
* 1tbs of hummus (2g carbs, 35 calories

Snack #1 Total: 22g Carbohydrates, 175 Calories, 2.7 units of insulin. To be eaten at 12:00



4. Between classes, I go to the gym and workout. I usually suspend insulin delivery or take my pump off to ensure my blood sugars don't drop. I will burn 750 calories most days doing intense cardio for an hour, and eat lunch right after. As soon as I finish my work out, I will give myself 6 units of insulin, to cover my lunch which includes:

* baby snack carrots (8g carbs, 35 calories)
* 2tbs of hummus (4g carbs, 70 calories)
* sandwich with thin whole wheat whole grain bread (2 slices), salami (1 slice), ham (30g), turkey (30g), provolone cheese (1 slice), boston lettuce (2 pieces), mustard, light mayo (1tbs). (36g carbs, 280 calories)

Lunch Total: 48g Carbohydrates, 385 Calories, 6 units of insulin. To be eaten at 3:00.



5. Right after my classes let out, I will do some homework and eat another snack. At 4:30 I'll give 2.7 units of insulin to cover my snack which includes:

* 100g of pear slices (15g carbs, 58 calories)
* 50g of kiwi (7g carbs, 30 calories)

Snack #2 Total: 22g Carbohydrates, 78 Calories, 2.7 units of insulin. To be eaten at 4:45.



6. After I study for an hour, I go to my yoga class at 6 pm for an hour. I burn 120 calories and do not wear my insulin pump due to it getting in the way. Before I make dinner, I will give 2.5 units of insulin, to cover my dinner which includes:

* a whole bag of california medley steamed veggies (20g carbs, 120 calories)
* 140g of chicken breast (0g carbs, 140 calories)
* seasoning and 2tbs of parmesan cheese (0g carbs, 43 calories)

Dinner Total: 20g of Carbohydrates, 303 Calories, 2.5 units of insulin. To be eaten at 7:45



7. Before bed, I like to indulge in something sweet, my favorite thing being popsicles. I will give 2.5 units of insulin to cover my bedtime snack which includes:

* 1 caribbean frozen fruit bar (20g carbs, 130 calories)

Snack #3 Total: 20g Carbohydrates, 130 Calories, 2.5 units of insulin. To be eaten at 9:30pm

I'm actually feeling really hopeful and excited about this. I will definitely keep you updated on my journey to better maintained blood sugars.
