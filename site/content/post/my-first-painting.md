This is the very first tiny painting that I ever did. It has a very special spot in my heart. It's a view of the Golden Gate Bridge, and I painted it because my boyfriend at the time was very infatuated with San Francisco. I actually ended up gifting the painting to one of my ex boyfriends friends as a graduation present, because he was planning on moving to the Bay Area full time. 



The more I look at the painting, the more things I want to change about it now that my skills have increased a bit. I'm not big on repeat paintings, but this is one that I am going to repaint for sure.
