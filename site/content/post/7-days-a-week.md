Today has been spent driving all over town, going from interview to interview (5 in total!!!!), but I've still managed to follow my structured plan for my blood sugars and calorie and carbohydrate intake. I did not make it to the gym today, but I'm planning on going extra hard for tomorrow's numerous gym sessions. Fridays and Saturdays are obviously something I didn't quite take into account with how scattered those days typically are for me. I have a very active social life, which I'm not complaining about at all, by the way! But that means that I usually have lots of plans to work around in regards to this challenge.
