To all my dear fans that absolutely do not know that this website exists yet, 

I was gifted this website and domain name from an old friend. I was encouraged to use it but rarely did because, well, I didn't want to. But now I do and I'm excited. I genuinely feel though as if nobody is reading.

*If you're reading this send me a sign*

Anyway, I was just fired from a job that I had for 4 years and absolutely loved. I had several positions at this company and was "let go" on a technicality. I was severely devastated to say the very least and immediately sent myself into a self-inflicted downward spiral. After many days of moping, I applied to 18 different places. I put myself through multiple interviews per day for several days, ultimately receiving six job offers and then I finally settled on one. I started this new job last week and am happy to report that I genuinely enjoy the environment, the work, and the people. That being said, though, it's still really difficult to transition into a new work environment and I don't think that all of this could have come at a worse time. 

Aside from the job thing, my personal life is still thriving and my education is still on track and doing well. I just wish for my sake that my life was perfect, but we all know that's impossible on many levels. 

To whoever is reading this, I love you. You may or may not know me but if you took the time out of your day to read a shitty paragraph about my shitty situation, I love you. 

Signing off~
